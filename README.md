# Journey Back to Earth (3D Game)
## Story:
Journey Back to Earth is a 3D game based on science fiction and adventure.

The beginning of our story is where humanity sent scientists to different planets, as they needed to explore new life, materials, or for a habitable planet. One of those scientists is our main character. While exploring a planet from distance, meteors blocked the way so the ship had to collide on the planet, because of the planet's gravity. Both our character and the ship survived, but the ship needed necessary repairs in order to work again and go back to earth. The ship could only be repaired by mining, searching for items or other ships and try to get components that will allow the player to fix the ship and find new discoveries. However, there is no oxygen in that planet so our character needs to visit his ship or ther ships often

Can you help our character to survive and go back to earth?
